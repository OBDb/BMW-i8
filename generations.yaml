    description: "The BMW i8 was a revolutionary plug-in hybrid sports car that served as the halo model for BMW's 'i' sub-brand. Available as a coupe (I12) and later as a roadster (I15), it featured futuristic styling with butterfly doors, a distinctive layered design approach, and advanced aerodynamics. The lightweight construction utilized a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) passenger cell mounted on an aluminum chassis. Power came from a hybrid system combining a turbocharged 1.5L three-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels with an electric motor powering the front wheels, providing all-wheel drive capability. At launch, the combined system produced 357 HP, later increased to 369 HP. Performance was impressive with 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 4.4 seconds, combined with remarkable efficiency for a sports car, achieving approximately 76 MPGe. The initial electric-only range was about 15 miles, increased to 18 miles for the updated 2018+ models with an 11.6 kWh battery (up from 7.1 kWh). The interior featured a driver-focused layout with sustainable materials and advanced technology. Despite its technological achievements, sales remained modest due to the high price point and specialized nature of the vehicle. Production ended in 2020 after approximately 20,000 units, with the i8 leaving a legacy as one of the most distinctive and innovative vehicles in BMW's history, pioneering technologies and construction methods that influenced later models."
