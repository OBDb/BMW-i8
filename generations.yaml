    description: "The BMW i8 was a revolutionary plug-in hybrid sports car that served as the halo model for BMW's 'i' sub-brand. The first generation coupe (I12) featured futuristic styling with butterfly doors, a distinctive layered design approach, and advanced aerodynamics. The lightweight construction utilized a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) passenger cell mounted on an aluminum chassis. Power came from a hybrid system combining a turbocharged 1.5L three-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels with an electric motor powering the front wheels, providing all-wheel drive capability. The combined system produced 362 PS (357 HP). Performance was impressive with 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 4.4 seconds, combined with remarkable efficiency for a sports car, achieving approximately 76 MPGe. The electric-only range was about 15 miles (37 km) under EPA/NEDC cycles with a 7.1 kWh lithium-ion battery. Series production began in April 2014, with deliveries to German customers in June 2014 and U.S. customers in August 2014. The interior featured a driver-focused layout with sustainable materials and advanced technology. It was the first production car with laser headlights, reaching farther than LED lights."

    end_year: 2020
    description: "The 2018 update of the BMW i8 brought significant technical improvements while maintaining the iconic I12/I15 platform. The battery capacity increased from 7.1 kWh to 11.6 kWh, enabling electric-only range to rise to 55 km (34 miles) for the coupe and 53 km (33 miles) for the roadster. The electric motor output increased by 12 PS to 143 PS, boosting combined system output to 374 PS (369 HP). In May 2018, the long-anticipated roadster variant (I15) was launched with deliveries beginning in May 2018, featuring a two-seat open-top configuration with an electric two-piece folding roof. Both coupe and roadster variants featured the same enhanced powertrain and were produced until June 2020 when the entire i8 line ended production after approximately 20,465 total units (16,581 coupes and 3,884 roadsters). The i8 left a legacy as one of the most distinctive and innovative vehicles in BMW's history, pioneering technologies and construction methods that influenced later models."
